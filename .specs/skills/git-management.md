# Git Usage

## Commit Message Prefixes

- "fix:" for bug fixes
- "feat:" for new features
- "perf:" for performance improvements
- "docs:" for documentation changes
- "style:" for formatting changes
- "refactor:" for code refactoring
- "test:" for adding missing tests
- "chore:" for maintenance tasks

## Rules

- Use lowercase for commit messages
- Keep the summary line concise with a maximum of 100 characters
- Reference issue numbers when applicable
- commit message should be answer to the _why_ question about changes, not _what_ changed.
- use `git diff` and make sure you omit `.specs/` directory that contains verbose unrelated files(but include in commit).
